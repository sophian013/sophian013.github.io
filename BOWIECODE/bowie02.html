          <h2>The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust: 1972</h2>
          <p>a breakthrough album and a pivitol point in Bowie's career. retrospectively Ziggy Stardust is considered one of Bowie's best works and has appeared on numerous lists of the greatest albums of all time. Bowie had ideas for a musical based on the album, although this project never came to fruition; ideas were later used for Diamond Dogs (1974). Ziggy Stardust has been reissued several times and was remastered in 2012 for its 40th anniversary. </p>

          <h2>Alladin Sane: 1973</h2>
          <p>the signature Ziggy red hair colour was Schwarzkopf Red Hot Red, and the haircut cost Bowie £2. rather than continue the Ziggy Stardust character directly, Bowie decided he would create a new persona, Aladdin Sane. The character reflected the theme of "Ziggy goes to America"[9][7] and, according to Bowie, was less defined and "clear cut" than Ziggy Stardust, and "pretty ephemeral".[13] According to biographer David Buckley, the character was a "schizoid amalgamation" that was reflected in the music.[9]</p>

            <h2></h2>
            <p>In 1967, David Bowie released his first album, The World of David Bowie. This release marked the landing of one of the 
                century’s most influential artists, with incredible style to boot. Bowie burst onto the scene like no 
                one before him and with more influence than anyone could have ever imagined. Into the world came a 20-year-old gentleman with charisma, 
                rebellion and style, and whose position at the
                top would never dwindle.

            <p>Next came Hunky Dory, potentially Bowie’s most successful         
                The album came complete with hits that would secure Bowie’s place as the best singer of his time, with hits such as Oh, You Pretty Things, Life on Mars? and Changes spanning across the 11 track album.
                 With the release of Hunky Dory came Bowie’s experimentation with fashion, and a time when Ziggy Stardust started to come to the forefront of his style. Eyeliner, skintight outfits and the iconic zigzag across his eye all became staples for Bowie. It was at this point that he well and truly secured his status as a full fashion icon. Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange was one of Bowie’s biggest influences, and it massively showed in his style. </p>

            <p>At the start of the 90s, Bowie met Iman, the Somalian supermodel who would become
                his long-term girlfriend. The relationship in absolutely no way affected Bowie's courageous 
                (and ever so slightly camp) dress sense-if anything it spurred him on to become more experimental.

            <p>The end of the 1990s and the start of the millennium saw Bowie 
                start to morph into an era that he only very briefly experimented with 
                in his youth – the hippy. Some say it was Iman’s influence, others say it was him travelling the world, but whatever it was it was great. While he didn’t go all out, he did grow his hair and start to wear floral, calf length coats. Skip forward a few years and Bowie became a hippy in a more loose sense of the word: as a gentleman who liked to feel loose and free, with baggy trousers, waistcoats and wide shirts. </p>
